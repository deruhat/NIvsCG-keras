For Google and PRCG, you can check the github project of Dr. Tian-Tsong Ng: https://github.com/tiantsong/physical-cg

Here, we give two additional points:
1) For Personal Set, we use the [Downsized JPEG images (zip,55MB)].
2) For Google Set, we remove five images with incorrect labels after discussing via email with the first author of the dataset 
and obtaining his approval. The names of these five images:
- machine-selected-9.jpg
- plant-selected-19.jpg
- plant-selected-38.jpg
- scenery-selected-58.jpg
- scenery-selected-68.jpg
